# Day 1 – Collapsible Sidebar (React)
## 📌 Challenge
Rebuild an existing HTML/CSS sidebar as a **collapsible sidebar** using **React**.

## ✅ What I Did
- Converted static sidebar to a functional React component.
- Implemented toggle open/close with React `useState`.
- Reused and adjusted previous CSS styles.
- Prepared folder structure for future tweaks and responsiveness.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this folder inside your React app or run standalone.
2. `npm install` (if needed).
3. `npm run dev` to launch.

## 🔍 Notes
I practiced moving static structure into reusable React components
and managing basic state for UI interactions.
