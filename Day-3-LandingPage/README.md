# Day 3 – Attack on Titan–Inspired Landing Page

## 📌 Challenge
Build a simple, themed landing page using **vanilla HTML and CSS**, featuring:
- Hero section with bold message and CTA.
- Supporting “About” section.
- Clean header navigation and footer.
- Custom background image and emblem.
- Inspired by *Attack on Titan* aesthetics.

## ✅ What I Did
- Designed a full-page hero section with dramatic background overlay and vertical lines.
- Wrote thematic copy referencing the Scout Regiment and humanity’s fight for freedom.
- Added an About section for extra depth and world-building.
- Styled using CSS custom properties for colors, typography, and spacing.
- Implemented hover effects for nav links and CTA button.
- Structured layout for large desktop screens only — **not responsive yet**.

## 🎨 Theme & Aesthetic
- **Primary Colors:**
  - `#f4f4f4` (text)
  - `#ffd700` (Scout Regiment gold accent)
  - `#b40000` (deep red highlight)
  - Black background for dramatic contrast.
- **Fonts:**
  - Headings: `ditty` (custom or placeholder)
  - Body: `"Segoe UI", Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif`

```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. the test one contains an experimental Responsive version.
3. Scroll through the hero and about sections to see the themed layout.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **This landing page is currently desktop-only** — no responsive layout yet.
- Planned improvements: mobile adjustments, fluid layout, possible React version in the future.

## 🔍 Notes
- The background image was AI-generated with an AoT-inspired prompt.
- Vertical lines add visual structure to frame the page.
- Sticky header keeps nav accessible at all times.
- Good practice for flexbox, CSS custom props, and layered layout.
