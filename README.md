# Week 1 – Daily Frontend Challenges

Welcome to my **Week 1 Daily Frontend Challenges**.
This is part of my personal commitment to grow as a developer by building small, practical projects daily — and to keep my GitHub activity *real*, not faked.

## 🏆 **Purpose**

- Build *real* daily commits.
- Focus on **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React** basics.
- Sharpen skills with tiny, focused challenges.
- Keep a clear log of progress.

## 📂 **Structure**

Week-1-Frontend/
├── Day-1-sideBar/
│ ├── src/...
│ ├── README.md
│ └── ...
├── Day-2-animated-button/
├── Day-3-landing-page/
...

Each day has its own folder and README.

---

## 🔍 **How to Use**

1. Clone the repo.
2. Pick any day’s folder.
3. Open and run the mini project.
4. Read the `README.md` inside each day’s folder for instructions.

## 📜 **Notes**

This is for practice only — not production-ready.
My goal is to stay consistent and build real, useful pieces, one day at a time.

*Rule:  Progress, not perfection.*
