# Day 2 – Animated Buttons

## 📌 Challenge
Create an animated call-to-action button using **vanilla HTML and CSS** only — no JavaScript.

## ✅ What I Did
- Designed two buttons with hover and active states.
- Added box-shadow for a 3D push-down effect.
- Used CSS transitions for smooth animations.
- Tested click/press effects to simulate depth.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Hover or click the buttons to see the effects.

## 🔍 Notes
- No React version for this one — kept it simple.
- Might add more variations later (hover for `.btn2` is commented out for now).
- Learned more about CSS `box-shadow`, `transform`, and `transition`.
